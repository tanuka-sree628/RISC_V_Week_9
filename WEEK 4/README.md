## Synopsis of the Week

The week was an intense yet rewarding journey through the foundational concepts of MOS transistors, their simulation behaviour, and the robustness of CMOS circuits.

- DAY 1: Introduced to the fundamentals of MOSFET's, covering threshold voltage, channel formation, and inversion, along with a primer on SPICE simulation techniques.
- DAY 2: Explored velocity saturation effects and analyzed CMOS inverter Voltage Transfer Charateristics (VTC).
- DAY 3: Focused on determining the switching threshold voltage and extended into dynamic simulation scenarios.
- DAY 4: Initiated robustness evaluation through noise margin calculations.
- DAY 5: Concluded with robustness assessments under varying supply voltages and device parameters.
